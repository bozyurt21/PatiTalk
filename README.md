<h1 align="center">Pawgram - New Social Media For cats</h1>
<p align="center">The idea and the project is belong to Bensu Ã–zyurt.</p>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p align="left">The purpose of this app is to create a social media for cat owners and cat lovers. Please be aware of the fact this is not an app idea I am planning to go in market. I am doing this just for fun.</p>
<p align="left">The app aim to provide:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Help for those who had cat and does not know what to do</li>
  <li>Cute cat videos & photos</li>
  <li>Help for the street cats who had not feed and/or building a social help circle for cats</li>
  <li>Make people aware of their surrounding cats so they would feed them</li>
</ul>
<h2>Where did the idea came from?</h2>
<p align="left">I have a cat of my own but we also feeds those one in the street. Since we feed them, they always wait in the windows and corners of our house and also other cats which realized that we feed some, they started to come too which we felt so bad that we couldn't feed them all. I mean, it is kinda expensive to feed a lot of cats everyday but it beg me differ, if we show people that there are hungary cats around their surrounding would they start helping? So this app bornðŸ¥³ Although I am not planning on making anything out of it so for now this is just for fun.</p>
